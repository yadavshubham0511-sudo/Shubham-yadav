<b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> ; <b>15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) 
was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the president of India from 2002 to 2007.
</p>
<p>
    Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and aerospace engineering
. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
 Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in 
 India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He was known as the "Missile Man of 
 India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal
 organisational, technical, and political role in Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, India's second such test after
  the first test in 1974.
Kalam was elected as the president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata
 Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. He was widely referred to as the "People's President".
  He engaged in teaching, writing and public service after his presidency. He was a recipient of several awards, 
 including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
While delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent 
cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands attended the funeral ceremony held in his
 hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours. A memorial was inaugurated near
 his home town in 2017.

Early life and education
Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family 
in the pilgrimage center of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, Madras Presidency (now in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu)
. His father, Jainulabdeen Marakayar, was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, and his mother,
 Ashiamma, was a housewife.[5][6] His father owned a boat that ferried Hindu pilgrims between Rameswaram and</b>

After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam became a member of the Defence 
Research & Development Service and joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research
 and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. During his early career, he was involved in the design of 
 small hovercraft, and remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Later, he joined the Indian 
 National Committee for Space Research, working under renowned space scientist Vikram Sarabhai. He was 
 interviewed and recruited into Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) by H. G. S. Murthy, the first director 
 of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.
In 1969, Kalam transferred to ISRO where he became the project director of India's
 first satellite launch vehicle (SLV) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite 
 in near-earth orbit in July 1980. He had earlier started work on an expandable rocket project independently at 
 DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the approval from the Government of India to expand the programme to 
 include more engineers.[19] In 1963–64, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Goddard Space Flight
  Center in Greenbelt, and Wallops Flight Facility. Since the late 1970s, Kalam was part of the effort to 
  develop the SLV-3 and Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), both of which were successful.

In May 1974, Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha 
as the representative of Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, even though he was officially not part of the
project. In the 1970s, Kalam directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop
ballistic missiles using the technology from the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the union 
cabinet, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted funds for these aerospace projects under Kalam's directorship
through her discretionary powers. Kalam also played a major role in convincing the cabinet to conceal the true
 nature of these classified projects. His research and leadership brought him recognition in the 1980s, which 
prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.

Kalam worked with metallurgist V. S. R. Arunachalam, who was then scientific adviser to the Defence Minister,
 on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister R. Venkataraman on the simultaneous development of a quiver of
missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.[28] Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the
cabinet approval for allocating ₹3.88 billion (equivalent to ₹66 billion or US$780 million in 2023) for the project 
titled Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as its chief executive.
Kalam played a major role in the development of missiles including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic 
missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, despite inflated costs and time overruns
He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch 
vehicle technology.

Kalam served as the chief scientific adviser to the prime minister and secretary of the DRDO from July 1992 to
December 1999. He played a key organisational, political and technical role in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests
conducted in May 1998.Along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, he served as the chief project coordinator for
Chidambaram.

In 1998, Kalam worked with cardiologist Bhupathiraju Somaraju and developed a low cost
coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju stent".[38][39] In 2012, the duo designed a tablet
computer named the "Kalam-Raju tablet" for usage by healthcare workers in rural areas</b>
