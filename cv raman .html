<h2><U>C.V.Raman:</U></h2>
<p> Sir Chandrashekhar Venkata Raman (C.V.Raman) was an Indian Physicist,the first the nobke prize
in physics,1930,renowned for discovering the<b>THE RAMAN EFFECT</b>,where light changes wavelength
after scattering off materials,a phenomenon forming the basis of <b><u> RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY</u></b>,used in material anylaysis.
</p>
<h4>Early life:</h4><p>Chandrashekhar Venkata Raman was born at Tiruchirpalli in Tamil Nadu on 7th november 1888 to a physiscs teacher.
Raman was very sharp student.After doing his matriculation at 12,he was supposed to go abroad for higher studies,but after medical examination
,a British surgeon suggested against it.Rama attend Presidency College,MADRAS.A fter complettinghis graduation in 1904,and M.Sc. in physics in 1907,
Raman put through various significanct resesarches in the field of physics.He studied the diffraction of light and his thiesis on the subject was published in 1906.
</p>
<h4><u>Contribution and Achievements: </u></h4><p>On a sea voyage to Europe in 1921,Raman curioulsy noticed the blue
color of the glacier and the  Mediterranean.He was passionate to discover the reson of the blue color.Once Raman returned o  India, he performed
many experiments regarding to the scattering of light from water and transporent blocks of ice.According to the results,he establishedthe scientific explaination
for the blue color of sea-water and sky.</p>

<center><h1><u>The Raman Effect</u></h1></center>
<p> In chemistry and physics, Raman scattering or the Raman effect 
is the inelastic scattering of photons by matter, meaning that there is both an exchange 
of energy and a change in the light's direction. Typically this effect involves vibrational 
energy being gained by a molecule as incident photons from a visible laser are shifted to lower energy. 
This is called normal Stokes-Raman scattering.
Light has a certain probability of being scattered by a material. When photons are scattered, most of them are 
elastically scattered (Rayleigh scattering), such that the scattered photons have the same energy 
(frequency, wavelength, and therefore color) as the incident photons, but different direction.
 Rayleigh scattering usually has an intensity in the range 0.1% to 0.01% relative to that of a radiation source.
  An even smaller fraction of the scattered photons (about 1 in a million) can be scattered inelastically,
   with the scattered photons having an energy different (usually lower) from those of the incident photons—these
 are Raman scattered photons.[1] Because of conservation of energy, the material either gains or loses energy in
  the process.
The effect is exploited by chemists and physicists to gain information about materials for a variety of purposes by
 performing various forms of Raman spectroscopy. Many other variants of Raman spectroscopy allow rotational energy 
 to be examined, if gas samples are used, and electronic energy levels may be examined if an X-ray source is used, 
 in addition to other possibilities. More complex techniques involving pulsed lasers, multiple laser beams and so on are known.
The Raman effect is named after Indian scientist C. V. Raman, who discovered it in 1928 with 
assistance from his student K. S. Krishnan. Raman was awarded the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of Raman scattering.</p>
